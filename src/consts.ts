  `Hello, I’m Maya (She/They/It).\nI’m a creator who sits at the intersection of technology, worldbuilding, and systems design. My work tends to blur the line between engineering and storytelling; not because I’m chasing novelty, but because I’m interested in how complex systems, whether technical or social, actually function when people live inside them.\nTechnically, I work comfortably with infrastructure-level tooling: static sites, build pipelines, configuration-heavy systems, servers, and collaborative platforms. I’m particularly experienced in environments where many moving parts have to coexist, version control, CI/CD, hosting constraints, plugin ecosystems, and long-lived projects maintained by communities rather than companies. I care less about chasing frameworks and more about understanding where things run, how they break, and how to make them resilient.\nCreatively, I’m a science fiction and fantasy writer with a strong interest in speculative governance, myth-making, and emergent worlds. I enjoy building settings that feel internally coherent, worlds with infrastructure, politics, culture, and history that interlock rather than float independently. That same instinct carries into my technical work: I treat systems as lived spaces, not abstract diagrams.\nA recurring theme in my projects is accessibility and continuity, making things understandable, navigable, and sustainable for people who weren’t there at the beginning. Whether that’s documentation, visual explanations, news-style writing, or structured community tools, I gravitate toward work that lowers the barrier to participation without flattening complexity.\nI’m not particularly interested in being a “pure” anything, not a pure developer, not a pure writer, not a pure designer. I’m much more interested in synthesis: how technical systems shape social behaviour, how narratives influence participation, and how good structure can make creativity easier rather than more constrained.\nThis site is a place where those threads meet: essays, experiments, documentation, and observations from ongoing projects. Some of it will be technical, some reflective, some speculative, all of it shaped by the same curiosity about how systems, stories, and people interact over time.`.trim();
