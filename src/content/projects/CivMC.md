## What it is

CivMC is a long-running, player-driven sandbox where politics, diplomacy, economics, and infrastructure emerge from the community.  
My role inside CivMC is an ongoing mix of **governance work, political coordination, documentation, and systems design**.

This project is less about “a build” and more about **building durable institutions**: policies people can understand, systems that can survive turnover, and tools that help communities coordinate under pressure.

## What I do

- Draft and refine **governance documents** (constitutions, amendments, policy language, role definitions)
- Design **administrative systems** for accountability and continuity (processes, permissions, decision flows)
- Build **information architecture** for Discord communities (channels, categories, role structures, public vs internal comms)
- Produce **structured writeups** and updates that make complex situations understandable to newcomers
- Experiment with **metrics and visualization** for “state development” and community health

## What I’m learning

- How informal power becomes formal authority (and how it can be constrained responsibly)
- How to design rules that are clear enough to follow, but flexible enough to survive reality
- What actually reduces conflict: incentives, transparency, and predictable process
- How to communicate controversial decisions in ways that preserve legitimacy

## Outcomes (so far)

- More readable, more durable governance language
- Repeatable templates for community organization and documentation
- Early iterations of structured analysis and data-driven community reporting

## Notes

This is an ongoing practice in applied political design: real people, real incentives, and real consequences, inside a simulated world.
